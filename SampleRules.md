# Rules of Conduct
## Be Respectful
Above all it is important that we treat others with the utmost respect, not only here but in our lives in general. Always treat other members with the level of respect you would wish to be accorded. Failure to be mindful of others viewpoints or experiences can undermine group trust and impede personal progress.

## Maintain Confidentiality.
It is essential that everything said in group therapy is kept private by all group members and leaders. Failing to adhere to this rule can undermine trust within the group and hinder members’ attempts to heal.

## Commitment to Attendance.
This is another essential rule for nearly any group – it is vital that each member attend every session, arrive on time, and stay for the entire session. In addition to the absent member missing valuable information and practice, absence or late arrival/early leaving can interrupt the whole group.

## No Socializing during Group meetings.
Group therapy is not a social activity, it is a therapeutic one. Casual conversation can eat into valuable meeting time and slow progress for all members of the group. Socializing should be saved for after group meetings.

## Participate.
Group therapy doesn’t have much of a therapeutic effect if the members do not participate! The potential for healing and growth rests on how much group members are able to connect, share, and learn from one another. It is essential for all group members to truly participate for this treatment to be effective.

## Be mindful of your surroundings.
Remember this is a safe space for people seeking counseling. Words can be what digs you out of despair, but they can also send you deeper into it. Being careless with your words can have lasting consequences, remember to think twice before you speak.
