Mental wellness is a growing public health concern, according to the WHO it affects an estimated 450 million people worldwide. (1) And Demand for psychiatric help far outpaces supply. NotAlone was built as a tool to connect people who are seeking help and to let them know -  they're not. alone.

## The Problem
The American Psychological Association says "Regularly talking and listening to others can help you put your own problems in perspective. Many people experience mental health difficulties, but few speak openly about them... Oftentimes, you may feel like you are the only one struggling â€” but you're not." (2)

## The Mission
Our mission is to benefit society by improving the lives and mental wellness of people everywhere. Group therapy is a proven method to manage mental health conditions and we aim to make therapy available to people anytime, anywhere.

## How it works
Frequently the biggest hurdle in achieving mental wellness is just taking the first step. Our team aims to remove the barrier to entry for people seeking help. We allow users to connect to people combatting the same issues all over the world, all from the comfort of their own homes.

Our users join self-regulating communities of people facing the same struggle. These are communities are built from users worldwide. By bringing together complete strangers we minimize the risk users run into people they're trying to avoid and let our users know that their struggle truly is universal.
