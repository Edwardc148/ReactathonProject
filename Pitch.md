Mental wellness is a growing public health concern that according to the WHO affects an estimated 450 million people worldwide (1). Demand for psychiatric help far outpaces supply. NotAlone was built as a tool connect people who need help and let them know that they're not alone.

## The Problem
The American Psychological Association says "Regularly talking and listening to others also helps you put your own problems in perspective. Many people experience mental health difficulties, but few people speak openly about them... Oftentimes, you may feel like you are the only one struggling â€” but you're not. It can be a relief to hear others discuss what they're going through, and realize you're not the only one."

## The Mission
The mission of NotAlone is benefit society by improving the lives and mental wellness of people everywhere. Group therapy is a proven method to manage mental health conditions and NotAlone aims to make therapy available to people anytime, anywhere.
