There are two kinds of group therapy sessions:

1) Open groups: new participants are welcome to join sessions at any time; for example, Alcoholics Anonymous is an open session which invites new members to join in any session.
2) Closed groups: the therapy sessions are closed to a core group of participants; new participants may only be welcomed when a new group is formed (Cherry, 2017).

In terms of what will actually happen in a group therapy session, sessions can vary based on the topic, participants, and treatment progress, but these are some of the common features:

The participants will meet in a room with chairs formed into a large circle.
The session may begin with group members introducing themselves and explaining why they are in therapy.
In subsequent sessions (in closed groups) or in every session (in open groups), members may also share their progress and any updates since the previous group meeting.


The flow of the session will depend on the same factors described above, but it will likely follow one of these general paths:

1) Free-form: each participant will engage with the group as much or as little as s/he wants, and participants are the main drivers of the discussion with facilitation and guidance from the therapist.
2) Planned: in other cases, the therapist may have a set agenda for the meeting with planned activities and skill building exercises for group members to engage in (Cherry, 2017).

5 Guidelines and Rules for Group Therapy
Whatever type of group therapy you attend, the general rules will likely be the same. These are the rules must be followed for the safety of the group and effectiveness of the treatment. Certain types of groups may have additional rules, but there is a core set of five rules that are essential for successful group therapy.

These five rules are:

+ Maintain Confidentiality. It is essential that everything said in group therapy is kept private by all group members and leaders. Failing to adhere to this rule can undermine trust within the group and hinder members’ attempts to heal.
+ Commitment to Attendance. This is another essential rule for nearly any group – it is vital that each member attend every session, arrive on time, and stay for the entire session. In addition to the absent member missing valuable information and practice, absence or late arrival/early leaving can interrupt the whole group.
+ No Socializing with Group Members. Group therapy is not a social activity, it is (hopefully!) a therapeutic one. Forming close friendships or other bonds with group members can interfere with group success, especially if members become hesitant to share personal information because of another group member. Friendships should be saved for after the group has disbanded.
+ Communicate with Words, Not Actions. This rule could be considered the exact opposite of the standard advice storytellers receive: “Show, don’t tell!” People have different reactions to physical contact, so expressing yourself through words instead of physical actions is an important rule to follow.
+ Participate. Group therapy doesn’t have much of a therapeutic effect if the members do not participate! The potential for healing and growth rests on how much group members are able to connect, share, and learn from one another. It is essential for all group members to truly participate for this treatment to be effective.

Benefits of Group Therapy
For participants, there are many reasons why group therapy is a treatment worth considering.

The main advantages include:

+ It allows participants to receive support and encouragement from other members of the group, helping them to feel less alone or isolated.
+ Group therapy provides an opportunity for group members to act as role models for other members, especially when the group is composed of participants at different stages of treatment. Even if all participants are at the same stage, some participants will naturally be more successful at managing certain types of problems than others, and group members can share their experiences and learn from each other.
+ It is usually more affordable than individual treatment, since the therapist’s time is shared with other clients.
+ Group therapy provides a safe environment for group members to practice new behaviors without fear of judgment.
+ Interacting with others in group therapy will help the therapist to see first-hand how a client interacts with others and behaves in a social situation, allowing the therapist to provide targeted feedback and suggestions to each client (Cherry, 2017).
