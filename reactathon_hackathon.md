“The best part about being with a group is
that you don’t have to do everything alone.” – Anonymous

The American Psychological Association notes another important benefit of group therapy: diversity. We all have different experiences, backgrounds, and personalities, which leads us to our own unique perspective on the world. Working with a group can help clients see things from a new perspective, which may illuminate new ways to take on old problems and new strategies to overcome obstacles that seem insurmountable (APA, 2017).

## Types of group therapy:

### Psychoeducational
+ A group that provides its members with the information they need to address or cope with their problems
+ Usually structured with specific topics to cover

### Process Oriented
Groups that are focused on the experience of users sharing with each other. These groups discussion driven, seldom having a set agenda.


## Problems we solve:
1. Anonymity / Confidentiality
2. Ease of Attendance
3. Separation of concerns
+ No Socializing with Group Members. Group therapy is not a social activity, it is (hopefully!) a therapeutic one. Forming close friendships or other bonds with group members can interfere with group success, especially if members become hesitant to share personal information because of another group member. Friendships should be saved for after the group has disbanded.
